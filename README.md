# PwC - Cars 2nd Assessment

In the master-2 branch, The assessment is done in Jersey framework, but due to error in CarsConfig.java file (The hierarchy of the type CarsConfig is inconsistent ; The method register(Class<CarsRestService>) is undefined for the type CarsConfig)
  
I then finished my assessment via Springboot, JPA, MYSQL and Hibernate.
In the master branch, the Springboot one is uploaded

## Complete assessment with all tables and foreign keys = Master branch
